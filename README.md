# ðŸ’¸ SmartExpense - Personal Finance Manager (C Project)

**Author:** Dharmanshu Singh  
**Language:** C  
**Platform:** GCC (Linux/Mac)  
**Purpose:** End-to-end personal finance management tool in C, demonstrating mastery of C programming concepts.

---

## Overview

SmartExpense is a **command-line personal finance manager** built entirely in C.  
It allows users to **track income and expenses**, set a **monthly budget**, view **summaries**, and **export data to CSV**.  

This project demonstrates practical usage of C programming concepts including **structs, dynamic memory management, file I/O, enums, time handling, modular programming, and string manipulation**.

## Features

1. **User-friendly CLI with colorized output** using ANSI escape codes.
2. **Add transactions** with:
   - Type: Income / Expense
   - Amount in INR
   - Category
   - Short description
3. **List transactions** in **chronological order** with IDs for easy reference.
4. **Delete transactions** using their ID.
5. **Summary & Analytics**:
   - Total income and expenses
   - Net balance
   - Average expense per transaction
   - Category-wise breakdown
6. **Budget Management**:
   - Set monthly budget
   - Check if budget is exceeded
7. **Data persistence**:
   - Transactions are saved in binary files specific to each user
   - Export transactions to CSV for external analysis
8. **Personalized greeting** for the user at program start.

## C Programming Concepts Used

- **Structs:** `Transaction`, `TxList`, `Budget`, `CategorySummary`  
- **Dynamic memory management:** `malloc`, `realloc`, `free`  
- **Enums:** `TxType` for income/expense  
- **File I/O:** Binary file read/write for persistence; CSV export  
- **Time handling:** `time_t`, `struct tm`, `strftime` for timestamps  
- **Strings:** Safe input handling with `fgets` and `strcspn`  
- **Functions & modularity:** All main operations are encapsulated in separate functions  
- **Error handling:** Validates file operations, input, and IDs  

This demonstrates **mastery of fundamental and intermediate C programming concepts**, as well as real-world problem solving.
